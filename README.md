# scli (Simple CLI)

Very simple implementation of a command line interface that supports sub commands.
Is Based on [ffcli](https://github.com/peterbourgon/ff/tree/main/ffcli) but with a few features I do not need removed,
and some added concepts from [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) like command aliases and argument validation.
